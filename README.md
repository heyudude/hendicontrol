# hendicontrol
This is a plugin for craftbeerpi3 to be used with a modified Hendi induction cooker (according to https://github.com/AHm74/hendictrl/wiki). It is based on the original code from https://github.com/AHm74/hendictrl but it combines a gradient based on/off control with adaptive power control.
